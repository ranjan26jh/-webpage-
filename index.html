    <p>Hello, my name is Shashiranjan jha and I am an Android developer. I have been developing Android applications for over 2 years and have experience with a wide range of Android devices. I have also worked on developing Android applications for locals. My goal as an Android developer is to create applications that are not only useful and intuitive, but also visually appealing. I believe that good design is essential to creating a successful Android application. I am always looking to improve my skills and learn new technologies so that I can create the best possible applications for my users.</p>

    <p>Varanasi is a city on the Ganges river in northern India that has a central place in pilgrimage, death, and mourning in the Hindu world, even as the traditions are transformed in the face of modernization, generational changes and emigration. The city has a syncretic tradition of Muslim artisanship that underpins its tourism. The name Varanasi was officially so revived after 1947, but the city is still widely known by its earlier name Banaras or Benares (Banāras; [bəˈnaːrəs] (listen)), and its ancient name Kashi..<br><br><br>        <img style="float:left"src="https://www.travelseewrite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Me-at-Varanasi-min.jpeg" width="250">
Varanasi is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities. Kashi, its ancient name, was associated with a kingdom of the same name of 2,500 years ago.  
<br>
Since ancient times, the city has been an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage, mysticism and poetry contributing to its cultural importance.[25] Tulsidas wrote his Awadhi language epic, the Ramcharitmanas, a Bhakti movement reworking of the Sanskrit Ramayana, in Varanasi.

<br><br>
The Lion capital of Ashoka at nearby Sarnath has been interpreted to be a commemoration of the Buddha's first sermon there in the fifth century BCEIn the 8th century, Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi.
